# The Ultimate Liri-Node-App

# About this App

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.# concert-this

1. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
2. Data is retrieved by using the `axios` package to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. 
3. Liri will display the current Concert Dates, Song Information and Movie Details from said APIs.  
3. To make this work Liri takes in the following commands (see samples below): 

# concert-this
